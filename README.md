#Student Tracker

Allow me to track my students' progress through the cohort, and make notes about significant things that might affect them.

As a user
I want to be able to see a dashboard of my current students with a brief summary
So that I can track their progress

As a user
I want to view a student's grades in more detail
so that I can tell what subjects they need help with

As a user
I want to add comments about a student
so that I can remember specific information about them

As a user
I want to filter my comments based on certain tags
such "personal" and "career track", etc
So that I can search my notes
